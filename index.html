        <p>I am a new student to the University of Washingtons coding bootcamp. I am hoping to make a career change into software engineering, web development, or even video game level design. 
            I have been in sales and customer services for the last 12 years of my live and with how much my world got turned upside down at the start of the pandemic I decided to pursue one of my many passions. This website will serve many purposes to us.
            I will use this is as a central location to showcase many of the projects we will be working on through this course to share with employers but it will also catalog my growth as a developer. I greatly look forward to all I have to learn in this course and these first few weeks have
            been some of the most rewarding and challenging of my academic career.
