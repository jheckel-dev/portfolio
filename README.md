# portfolio
repository for my first edition of my deployable portfolio website to showcase the applications I have been creating and working on.
This portfolio will serve as my first attempt and a work in progress to showcase my work throughout my boot camp career. 
This will have been my first build from scratch on my own. 

I am using the horiseon assignment code as my jumping off point. I really like the simple structure and layout of it and I am struggling with working with multiple individual elements in CSS.

had to scrap using the horiseon assignment as a jumping off point and had to build it from the ground up. The navbar has been the most challenging part but figuring out how to use the float command properly made it work. You can do this.
